# Hi, I'm  Anh Mai Vu (you can call me Anh) ! 👋

My research focuses on AI in healthcare, with two main directions. First, I develop trustworthy and interpretable AI systems using explainable (XAI) models, reasoning frameworks, and visual grounding techniques to enable transparent and reliable clinical decision-making. Second, I advance human-centered AI by integrating human gaze data, medical images, and clinical reports to align model reasoning with clinicians’ workflows and improve diagnostic accuracy.
