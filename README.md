# Hi, I'm  Mai-Anh Vu (you can call me Anh) ! 👋

![Profile Banner](link_to_banner_image)

I'm passionate about researching, developing data processing and AI engineering packages, writing blogs, and participating in AI competitions. 
 

🌟 **Key Skills:**
## Skills

- **Programming:** Proficient in Python and R.
- **Frameworks:** Skilled in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
- **Deep Learning:** Experienced in implementing CNNs and Transformers for various tasks, including Image Segmentation, Object Detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Image Retrieval Model (with CLIP).
- **Research Skills:** Actively researched statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. I have three papers submitted to conferences and academic journals, with one as the first author.
- **Data Pipeline:** Experienced in SQL (BigQuery) and Airflow for building robust data pipelines, conducting A/B testing, and developing recommendation modules, including my work at Tiki.
- **Data Analytics:** Proficient in e-commerce product and customer segmentation.
- **Other Experiences:**
  - Developed a package for missing data imputation, available at [DIMVImputation](https://github.com/maianhpuco/DIMVImputation).
  - Initiated a data-focused blog covering topics related to working with data, including semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation, available at [maianh-learning.com](https://maianh-learning.com/blogs/domain_adaptation/).
  - Part-time involvement in logo detection projects (Object Detection).
  - Participated in an Information Retrieval competition involving CLIP models.
 
🚀 **Packages:**
- [DIMV - A Data Imputation Package](https://github.com/maianhpuco/DIMVImputation):
  DIMV is a powerful data imputation package designed to handle missing data efficiently. It offers robust imputation with regularization, ensuring reliable results. DIMV is easy to implement using a scikit-learn-style API and can be installed with a simple `pip` command. Explore the GitHub repository for detailed documentation and examples. Enjoy seamless data imputation with DIMV! Yay! 


📝 **Blog:**
- Check out my latest articles on [maianh-learning.com](https://maianh-learning.com/blogs/domain_adaptation/) where I explore Semi-Supervised Method (to exploit small data for more general case) and Domain Adaptation (when the data distribution of the test set is not similar to train set) . 
- [VAE]([Project_2_Link](https://github.com/maianhpuco/VAE): I write a tutorial about Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs)  (implementation) with illustration the differences compare to Auto Encoder and include example of application of VAEs in Topic Modeling 
- [Domain Adaptation](https://github.com/maianhpuco/learning-domain-adaptation):  Another Tutorial of how to deal with domain shift problem by using re-weighting sample technique.
